## Problem Statement

Efficient irrigation is a major concern in modern agriculture. Over-irrigation leads to water wastage, while under-irrigation affects crop yield. Farmers need a reliable, automated solution to control sprinkler systems based on real-time sensor input.

---

## Objectives

- Develop a system that takes scaled sensor inputs and predicts sprinkler states.
- Provide an intuitive web interface for farmers to input data and view results.
- Reduce water wastage through intelligent irrigation decisions.
- Demonstrate the feasibility of AI in real-world agricultural applications.

---

## Proposed Solution

We propose a **Smart Sprinkler System** built using machine learning and deployed with a Streamlit interface. The model predicts whether each sprinkler (parcel_0 to parcel_19) should be ON or OFF based on environmental sensor data.

## Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-sprinkler-system.git
   cd smart-sprinkler-system
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Place the `Farm_Irrigation_System.pkl` model in the project directory.

## How to Run

Run the Streamlit app using:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Then open the provided local URL in your browser to interact with the system.

---

## Model Overview

- The model is trained on scaled sensor data (20 features).
- It performs multi-output binary classification to predict the ON/OFF state for each of 20 sprinklers.
- Output: An array of 20 binary values (0 = OFF, 1 = ON).

---

## Features

- Accepts 20 real-time scaled sensor inputs.
- Predicts ON/OFF status for each sprinkler.
- Clean, interactive UI using Streamlit.
- Lightweight and fast response.

---

## Sample Use-Case

A farmer inputs current soil moisture, humidity, temperature, etc. (scaled between 0 and 1) into the app. The model instantly predicts which sprinkler zones should be turned ON, helping save water and optimize crop growth.

## Future Scope

- Integrate live sensor feed using IoT.
- Add automatic actuator control to trigger sprinklers directly.
- Use time-series models to predict irrigation schedules.
- Provide alerts or daily reports to farmers via SMS/email.
